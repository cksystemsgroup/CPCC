			<h2>Ground Station</h2>
			<p>Real vehicles are servers that can move in space and carry sensors, as well as actuators.
				Real vehicles provide a
				runtime environment for virtual abstractions of networked autonomous vehicles, which
				execute the actual missions.
				Virtual autonomous vehicles, or virtual vehicles, for short, represent
				a virtual mobile sensor network, whose nodes
				may be dynamically created and deployed for efficient
				and fast information aquisition.</p>
			<p>Ground stations are built like real vehicles, but do not move autonomously in space. With the
				exception of their
				GPS positions, ground stations have neither sensors, nor actuators. Real vehicles
				migrate terminated and defective
				virtual vehicles to the ground station for further use.</p>

			<h3>Configuration</h3>
			<p>
				The
				<em>Configuration</em>
				tab is where you can manage all the ground station settings like
				the ground station name, the ROS parameters, and the
				ground station own devices like the GPS receiver simulator.
			</p>

			<h3>ROS</h3>
			<p>
				The
				<em>ROS</em>
				tab lists the state of the configured ROS nodes and adapters.
			</p>

			<h3>Sensors</h3>
			<p>
				The
				<em>Sensors</em>
				tab allows you to manage the system wide sensor definitions.
				The
				<em>description</em>
				column displays the
				sensor names to be
				used in the virtual vehicles. The ground station
				automatically propagates
				changes in the sensor
				definitions to all
				real vehicles.
			</p>

			<h3>Real Vehicles</h3>
			<p>
				The
				<em>Real Vehicles</em>
				tab offers to administer your vehicle fleet. Each configured vehicle and
				ground station shows up
				here. Additionally to
				a real vehicle's name, type, and connection URL, it is
				this tab where you define its (convex)
				area of operation.
			</p>

			<h3>Virtual Vehicles</h3>
			<p>
				This tab permits the management of your
				<em>Virtual Vehicles.</em>
				Here, they may edited online, uploaded,
				replicated,
				terminated, deleted, downloaded, restarted, and viewed.
			</p>

			<h3>Tasks</h3>
			<p>This tab shows an overview of unfinished virtual vehicle tasks. On the ground station, new tasks
				only lead to
				virtual vehicle migration. Hence, this overview will be notoriously empty on ground stations.</p>

			<h3>Jobs</h3>
			<p>
				On both ground stations and real vehicles,
				<em>Jobs</em>
				take care of changes. Jobs are intended to be small, independent pieces
				of work that may run in parallel within a
				thread pool. There are jobs for
				synchronizing configuration data,
				for migrating virtual vehicles, for querying the
				state of real vehicles,
				as well as other ground stations, for
				handling stuck migrations, and for other purposes.
			</p>

			<h3>Map</h3>
			<p>
				The
				<em>Map</em>
				tab gives you a geographical overview of ongoing missions. You may choose between
				<a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
				or an empty map. The provided map menu allows you to view or hide
				real vehicles, real vehicle regions, planned real
				vehicle paths, and sensors to read.
